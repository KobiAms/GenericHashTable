Exercise 1 - Generic Hash Table

===Description ===

Program files:
GenericHashTble.c - implementation file for a generic hash file.
GenericHashTble.h - all the .c file functions stump and documentation.

funcation:
	createTable - create a brand new hash table, gets the settings from user.
	freeTable - delete the hash table and free's the memory
	add - add an Object(node) in the end of the list in the hashFunc index
	removeObj - delete an object with the same data from the table if exists.
	search - search for an equal Object in the table.
	printTable - print the whole table index by index.
	createObject - create a new object to insert to the table
	freeObject - release the Object memory and delete it.
	isEqual - checks if two data are equals
	intHashFunc - returns the object number section for int's
	strHashFunc - returns the object number section for str's
	freeRoot - delete all the objects in root from the table
	physicalIndex - return the actually index in the table (after multiply table)
	insertToSection - insert an object to a Section
	insertToRoot - try insert an object to a root
	multiplyTable - the function reallocate memory of table by 2 and orders the root's
	printRoot - print the whole data in some root by the insertion order
	searchInRoot - search an equal object  
	removeFromRoot - remove an object in a root if exists
